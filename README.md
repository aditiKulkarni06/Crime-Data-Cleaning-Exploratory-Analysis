# Crime Data Analysis (2020–Present)

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and analyzing crime data from 2020 to the present to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, regional differences, and potential socioeconomic correlations. 

The project uses Python to transform raw crime records into meaningful insights that can support data-driven decision-making.
