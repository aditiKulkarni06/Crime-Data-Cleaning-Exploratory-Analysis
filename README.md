# Crime Data Analysis (2020–Present)

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and analyzing crime data from 2020 to the present to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, regional differences, and potential socioeconomic correlations. 

The project uses Python to transform raw crime records into meaningful insights that can support data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives

* Clean and preprocess large-scale crime datasets
* Identify long-term and seasonal crime trends
* Analyze crime distribution across regions
* Examine relationships between crime and unemployment
* Explore demographic patterns in crime victimization
* Forecast future crime trends using time-series modeling

---

## Dataset

* **Primary Dataset:** *Crime Data from 2020 to Present* (Data.gov)

  * Includes crime date, type, location, region, victim demographics, and weapon codes
* **Supplementary Dataset:** Synthetic unemployment data (CSV)

  * Used to explore correlations between unemployment rates and crime trends

---

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Prophet (for time-series forecasting)

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and modeling techniques can be applied to large-scale crime datasets to uncover meaningful patterns and trends. By analyzing crime data across time, regions, and demographics, the study highlights seasonal variations, regional disparities, and potential relationships between crime rates and socioeconomic factors such as unemployment.

The use of time-series forecasting provides insights into potential future crime trends, supporting proactive planning and policy development. Overall, the project showcases how data-driven approaches can assist researchers, policymakers, and law enforcement agencies in making informed decisions based on empirical evidence.
